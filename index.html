<h1>Liar's Dice</h1>

<p>Every player starts the game with five dice. Each round, the players roll their dice. 
Players are only permitted to look at their own results. 
The first player begins the bidding by announcing any face value 
and the minimum number of dice on the table they believe 
rolled this face value. 
The next player must then either challenge the bid, or make a bid of their own. 
If the bid is challenge, the loser loses a die and the round ends. 
If the loser of the previous round did not run out of dice, 
then they begin the bidding on the new round. 
If the player chooses to makea bid, then that bid must consist of 
either a larger minimum number of dice on the table of any face value, 
or, if they choose to stick to the previously announced minimum number of dice, 
of a higher face value. 
A player wins if everyone else on the table lost all their dice.</p>
